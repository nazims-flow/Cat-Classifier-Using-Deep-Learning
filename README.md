# Cat-Classifier-Using-Deep-Learning
Cat classifier is a deep learning application built to differentiate between a cat and non-cat images. It is built and tested in three phases with the hardcode implementation of forward propagation and backward propagation . The optimization algorithm used is gradient descent reducing the cost of the function. 1.Implementing with the logistic regression test accuracy : 70.0% 2.Implementing with the two layer neural network the test accuracy improved to  72%. 3.Implementing with the four layer neural network the test accuracy improved to 80%
